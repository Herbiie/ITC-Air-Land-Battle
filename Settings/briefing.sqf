To start off with you have 150 deployment points - and no friendly forces outside of Gravia Airfield.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to start off is to buy a patrol base and a means of getting there.<br/>
<br/>
You start in the HQ building, so set up a patrol base through the theatre commander - he's the guy with all of the maps.<br/>
<br/>
Set up this patrol base wherever you want - but tactically it makes more sense to be near to the airfield for logistics.<br/>
<br/>
The further your patrol base is away, the further you will have to travel to get vehicles there.<br/>
<br/>
Then buy a means of getting to the patrol base - I recommend a Prowler, as that will leave you with 30 deployment points should you lose it and need to buy a new one.<br/>
<br/>
Drive to the patrol base and start missions - these are the quickest way to gain deployment points!
